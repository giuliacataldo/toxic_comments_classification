# toxic_comments_classification
I worked on this project with two classmates of mine as the final evaluation for our Text Mining and Data Visualization course.
We were assigned a dataset containing hundreds of thousands of toxic commets taken from wikipedia pages.
Our goal was to build a text processing pipeline that performs a text mining on the dataset.
We implemented two models: a BLSTM model and a BERT model, we then proceeded to compare them and draw conclusions.
